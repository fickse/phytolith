This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(maps)
library(fields)
library(raster)
library(dismo)
library(xtable)
library(knitr)

setwd('C:/projects/phytolith/')
p <- read.csv('data/dat.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
p <- p[-which(is.na(p$lon)),]
p$lon <- -1*p$lon

p$grass <- as.factor(p$phyto_content >= .25)
p$y <- p$phyto_content
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(p))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
