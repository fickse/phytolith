	abstract = {In studying correlates of social behavior, attitudes, and beliefs, a measurement model is required to combine information across a large number of item responses. Multiple constructs are often of interest, and covariates are often multilevel (e.g., measured at the person and neighborhood level). Some item–level missing data can be expected. This paper proposes a multivariate, multilevel Rasch model with random effects for these purposes and illustrates its application to self–reports of criminal behavior. Under assumptions of conditional independence and additivity, the approach enables the investigator to calibrate the items and persons on an interval scale, assess reliability at the person and neighborhood levels, study the correlations among crime types at each level, assess the proportion of variation in each crime type that lies at each level, incorporate covariates at each level, and accommodate data missing at random. Using data on 20 item responses from 2842 adolescents ages 9 to 18 nested within 196 census tracts in Chicago, we illustrate how to test key assumptions, how to adjust the model in light of diagnostic analyses, and how to interpret parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {We summarize the influences of harvester ants of the genus Pogonomyrmex on communities and ecosystems. Because of nest densities, the longevity of nests, and the amount of seed harvested and soil handled, harvester ants have significant direct and indirect effects on community structure and ecosystem functioning. Harvester ants change plant species composition and diversity near their nests. These changes result from differential seed predation by the ants, their actions as seed dispersers and competitors with other granivores, and the favorable soil conditions they create through their digging. Their nest building creates islands of increased nutrient density. In some areas, the effects of their activities may be so pervasive that plant community structure is strongly influenced. Ant removal studies, which would reveal their total impact, have generally not been done. Granivore removals have been conducted in North America where ants are of lesser importance than small mammals, in contrast to other areas (except Israel) where ants are dominant granivores. We review the influence of harvester ants on their competitors, predators, and nest associates, and catalog the factors that influence their foraging patterns and consequently their local distribution.},

	abstract = {The Patagonian steppe is formed by tussock grasses and shrubs in a bare-soil matrix (50\% cover), and as in other arid and semiarid systems, vegetation is arranged in patches. Although there is a good understanding of the probabilities of seedling establishment of Bromus pictus in relation to location within these patches, these probabilities account for only a portion of the spatial dynamics of the community. The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We first evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85\% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55\% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (≤10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analyzed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bare-ground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals. Vegetation patches play an important role in modifying ecological processes in arid and semiarid communities. Our results highlight the importance of seed distribution in the formation and maintenance of these patches.},

	abstract = {The episodic nature of water availability in arid and semiarid ecosystems has significant consequences on belowground carbon and nutrient cycling. Pulsed water events directly control belowground processes through soil wet-dry cycles. Rapid soil microbial response to incident moisture availability often results in almost instantaneous C and N mineralization, followed by shifts in C/N of microbially available substrate, and an offset in the balance between nutrient immobilization and mineralization. Nitrogen inputs from biological soil crusts are also highly sensitive to pulsed rain events, and nitrogen losses, particularly gaseous losses due to denitrification and nitrate leaching, are tightly linked to pulses of water availability. The magnitude of the effect of water pulses on carbon and nutrient pools, however, depends on the distribution of resource availability and soil organisms, both of which are strongly affected by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation cover, topographic position and soil texture. The ‘inverse texture hypothesis’ for net primary production in water-limited ecosystems suggests that coarse-textured soils have higher NPP than fine-textured soils in very arid zones due to reduced evaporative losses, while NPP is greater in fine-textured soils in higher rainfall ecosystems due to increased water-holding capacity. With respect to belowground processes, fine-textured soils tend to have higher water-holding capacity and labile C and N pools than coarse-textured soils, and often show a much greater flush of N mineralization. The result of the interaction of texture and pulsed rainfall events suggests a corollary hypothesis for nutrient turnover in arid and semiarid ecosystems with a linear increase of N mineralization in coarse-textured soils, but a saturating response for fine-textured soils due to the importance of soil C and N pools. Seasonal distribution of water pulses can lead to the accumulation of mineral N in the dry season, decoupling resource supply and microbial and plant demand, and resulting in increased losses via other pathways and reduction in overall soil nutrient pools. The asynchrony of resource availability, particularly nitrogen versus water due to pulsed water events, may be central to understanding the consequences for ecosystem nutrient retention and long-term effects on carbon and nutrient pools. Finally, global change effects due to changes in the nature and size of pulsed water events and increased asynchrony of water availability and growing season will likely have impacts on biogeochemical cycling in water-limited ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Land degradation is a problem prolific across semi-arid areas worldwide. Despite being a complex process including both biotic and abiotic elements, previous attempts to understand ecosystem dynamics have largely been carried out within the disparate disciplines of ecology and hydrology, which has led to significant limitations. Here, an ecohydrological framework is outlined, to provide a new direction for the study of land degradation in semi-arid ecosystems. Unlike other frameworks that draw upon hierarchy theory to provide a broad, non-explicit conceptual framework, this new framework is based upon the explicit linkage of processes operating over the continuum of temporal and spatial scales by perceiving the ecosystem as a series of structural and functional connections, within which interactions between biotic and abiotic components of the landscape occur. It is hypothesized that semi-arid land degradation conforms to a cusp-catastrophe model in which the two controlling variables are abiotic structural connectivity and abiotic functional connectivity, which implicitly account for ecosystem resilience, and biotic structural and function connectivity. It is suggested therefore that future research must (1) evaluate how abiotic and biotic function (i.e. water, sediment and nutrient loss/redistribution) vary over grass–shrub transitions and (2) quantify the biotic/abiotic structure over grass-shrub transitions, to (3) determine the interactions between ecosystem structure and function, and interactions/feedbacks between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem.

Four Salsola species from Central Asia were investigated in this study to determine the structural and functional relationships in photosynthesis of cotyledons compared to leaves, using anatomical (Kranz versus non-Kranz anatomy, chloroplast ultrastructure) and biochemical (activities of photosynthetic enzymes of the C3 and C4 pathways, 14C labeling of primary photosynthesis products and 13C/12C carbon isotope fractionation) criteria. The species included S. paulsenii from section Salsola, S. richteri from section Coccosalsola, S. laricina from section Caroxylon, and S. gemmascens from section Malpigipila. The results show that all four species have a C4 type of photosynthesis in leaves with a Salsoloid type Kranz anatomy, whereas both C3 and C4 types of photosynthesis were found in cotyledons. S. paulsenii and S. richteri have NADP- (NADP-ME) C4 type biochemistry with Salsoloid Kranz anatomy in both leaves and cotyledons. In S. laricina, both cotyledons and leaves have NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) C4 type photosynthesis; however, while the leaves have Salsoloid type Kranz anatomy, cotyledons have Atriplicoid type Kranz anatomy. In S. gemmascens, cotyledons exhibit C3 type photosynthesis, while leaves perform NAD-ME type photosynthesis. Since the four species studied belong to different Salsola sections, this suggests that differences in photosynthetic types of leaves and cotyledons may be used as a basis or studies of the origin and evolution of C4 photosynthesis in the family Chenopodiaceae.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are searching for models, frameworks, and principles that provide a bridge between theory and the practice of restoration. Successional management has been proposed as a useful model for managing and restoring invasive-plant-dominated rangeland because it provides a framework in which ecological processes can be manipulated by managers to achieve a desired plant community. Successional management identifies three general causes of succession (site availability [disturbance], species availability [colonization], and species performance) and suggests that managers address the ecological process influencing each general cause in a coordinated fashion to direct plant community dynamics. We tested successional management using various techniques to restore invasive-weed-dominated rangeland. Our hypothesis was that successively modifying the factors influencing the causes of succession in an integrated fashion would favor the establishment and abundance of native grasses over singularly applied treatments. Thus, we anticipated that the majority of responses to multiple treatments would be explained by higher order interactions, especially in the final year of the study (2004). To test this hypothesis, we used a model system within a Festuca campestris/Pseudoroegneria spicata habitat among pothole wetlands dominated by Centaurea maculosa and Potentilla recta, two invasive species. We used three herbicide treatments (none, 2,4-D, and picloram) to influence species performance; two seeding methods (imprinting, i.e., creating a small depression and broadcasting, and no-till drilling) to influence disturbance; three seeding rates (977, 1322, and 1557 seeds/m2) to influence colonization; and two cover crop treatments (with and without Triticum aestivum) to influence soil N and favor native grasses. Treatments were factorially arranged and replicated four times in a randomized complete block design in 2001 and sampled in 2002 and 2004. As predicted, plant response to treatments was dominated by two- and three-way interactions in 2004. The highest seeding rate (colonization) combined with no-till drilling (disturbance) produced the highest native grass density in 2002. These effects persisted into 2004 for P. spicata, but not for F. campestris or F. idahoensis. Combining picloram with no-till drill seeding also produced a high density of P. spicata. Drill seeding at 977 seeds/m2 favored F. idahoensis density, while no-till drilling at 1322 seeds/m2 favored its biomass in 2004. F. idahoensis established well after drill seeding with a cover crop and applying 2,4-D. Herbicides reduced native forb density and/or biomass, with early season forbs being more sensitive to picloram and summer forbs being more sensitive to 2,4-D. Herbicides increased exotic grasses' density and biomass but had no effect on native grasses. In most cases, integrating treatments that addressed multiple causes of succession favored a desired plant community. Thus, we accomplished our goal of using successional management to direct plant communities toward native desired species, but the treatments used did not improve species richness. Since naturally occurring native forbs did not respond favorably to any treatment combination, ecological restoration using successional management may best be thought of as an iterative procedure where various components and processes of the system are methodically repaired or replaced over time.},

	abstract = {In drylands of southeastern Utah, USA, the invasive exotic grass Bromus tectorum L. occurs in distinct spatial patterns suggesting soil control of ecosystem susceptibility to invasion. To improve our understanding of these patterns, we examined performance of B. tectorum in relation to additions of water, KCl, MgO, and CaO at seventeen 1600 m2 sites distributed across a calcareous soil gradient in Canyonlands National Park. Water additions resulted in a 57\% increase in B. tectorum establishment. Fall establishment was significantly correlated with silt and clay content in wet plots but not in dry plots, suggesting that texture effects on B. tectorum establishment patterns may be greater in wet years than in dry years. Applications of MgO resulted in a 49\% decrease in B. tectorum establishment, although MgO had no effect on whole-plot biomass at the end of the growing season. B. tectorum–soil relations were strongest during winter (December–March) when relative growth rates were negatively related to soil acid-neutralizing potential, sand and CaCO3 content, and a measure of bioavailable Mg; and positively related to silt and clay content, total N, measures of bioavailable Mn, P, and K, and a measure of magnetite indicating distributional patterns of eolian dust. As soils were persistently moist during this period, we attribute strong B. tectorum–soil patterns in winter to effects of low temperature on diffusion, microbial activity, and/or production of root exudates important for nutrient mobilization and uptake. In spring, there was a reversal in B. tectorum–soil relations such that loamy soils with higher B. tectorum densities were unfavorable for growth relative to sandy soils with higher warm-season water potentials. We conclude that resource limitations for B. tectorum in this study area shift seasonally, from water limitation of fall establishment, to nutrient limitation of winter growth, and back to water limitation of spring growth. Because study sites generally were arrayed along a hillslope gradient with downslope trends in soil vtexture and nutrient content, close B. tectorum–soil relations documented in this study indicate that a geomorphic framework is useful for understanding and predicting B. tectorum invasion patterns in dryland ecosystems of this region.},

	abstract = {Interannual variation in experimental field conditions produce variability in the results of experiments monitored over multiple years, termed here “year effects.” When experimental treatments are replicated in separate years, interannual variation may influence treatment effects and produce significant treatment by initiation-year interactions. Understanding the frequency and strength of these effects requires initiating identical experiments across years. We conducted a review of literature covering more than 500 experimental articles published in 7 journals between 1966 and 2008. Only 5\% of the 276 general ecological field studies initiated experiments in multiple years. This rarity was even more evident in the journal Restoration Ecology, in which none of the 173 surveyed experimental studies initiated experiments in multiple years. In contrast, 48\% of the 58 field experiments published in an agronomy journal were replicated across years. We found only 17 studies that tested treatment by initiation-year interactions. Despite their rarity, 76\% of these studies found significant interactions between treatment and initiation year. We conclude that the results of many ecological field experiments are likely to be contingent on the year in which they are implemented. We discuss the importance of treatment by initiation-year interactions in ecology and restoration, factors that have hindered the inclusion of temporal replication in the past, and some suggestions for the appropriate design and analysis of temporally replicated experiments. We argue for more deliberate investigation of temporal contingency in ecological experimentation, especially in the field of restoration ecology, which may be particularly sensitive to treatment by initiation-year interactions.},

Maximum values were recorded during Mar–Jul 2009 when horizontal sediment fluxes measured with BSNE samplers ranged from 16.3 to 1251.0 g m−2 d−1 in unburned plots (n = 8; data represent averages of three sampler heights per plot), 35.2–555.3 g m−2 d−1 in burned plots that were not treated (n = 5), and 21.0–44,010.7 g m−2 d−1 in burned plots that received one or more rehabilitation treatments that disturbed the soil surface (n = 12). Fluxes during this period exhibited extreme spatial variability and were contingent on upwind landscape characteristics and surficial soil properties, with maximum fluxes recorded in settings downwind of treated areas with long treatment length and unstable fine sand. Nonlinear patterns of wind erosion attributable to soil and fetch effects highlight the profound importance of landscape setting and soil properties as spatial factors to be considered in evaluating risks of alternative post-fire rehabilitation strategies. By Mar–Jul 2010, average flux for all plots declined by 73.6\% relative to the comparable 2009 period primarily due to the establishment and growth of exotic annual plants rather than seeded perennial plants. Results suggest that treatments in sensitive erosion-prone settings generally exacerbated rather than mitigated wind erosion during the first 3 years post fire, although long-term effects remain uncertain.},

We conducted a seeding experiment on an arid (15.4 cm rain/year), historically heavily-grazed rangeland in Northern Arizona to test the effects of seeding technique and simulated seasonal climate scenarios on germination and recruitment of four species of native, cool-season bunchgrasses: Achnatherum hymenoides, Hesperostipa comata, Poa secunda, and Elymus elymoides. Initial results indicated that C3 grasses germinated significantly more in drill-seeded treatments under simulated high precipitation years than in other treatment types. Five years post-treatment, P. secunda and E. elymoides were not observed but simulated drill-seeded treatments, had significantly higher densities of A. hymenoides and H. comata recruits relative to most other treatment types. Simulated drill seeding also increased soil disturbance which increased the establishment of the invasive weed Salsola tragus in year 1, but not thereafter. Although it appears critical to coordinate effective seeding techniques with high winter–spring precipitation, predicting such events may not be possible at some sites, suggesting that seeding low elevation, arid rangelands of the Colorado Plateau may not always be realistic under a future climate that is drier and less predictable.},

Recent advances in dryland development, however, together with the integrative approaches of global change and sustainability science, suggest that concerns about land degradation, poverty, safeguarding biodiversity, and protecting the culture of 2.5 billion people can be confronted with renewed optimism. We review recent lessons about the functioning of dryland ecosystems and the livelihood systems of their human residents and introduce a new synthetic framework, the Drylands Development Paradigm (DDP). The DDP, supported by a growing and well-documented set of tools for policy and management action, helps navigate the inherent complexity of desertification and dryland development, identifying and synthesizing those factors important to research, management, and policy communities.},

	abstract = {The health of arid and semiarid lands needs to be monitored, particularly if they are used to produce food and fiber, and are prone to loss of vegetation cover and soil. Indicators of landscape health based on remotely sensed data could cost-effectively integrate structural and functional attributes of land surfaces across a range of scales. In this paper, we describe a new index for remotely monitoring changes in the health of land. The new index takes important aspects of landscape structure and function into account by focusing on the potential for landscapes to lose or ‘leak’ (not retain) soil sediments. We combined remotely sensed vegetation patchiness data with digital elevation model (DEM) data to derive a quantitative metric, the landscape leakiness index, LI. This index is strongly linked to landscape function by algorithms that reflect the way in which spatial configuration of vegetation cover and terrain affect soil loss. Linking LI to landscape function is an improvement on existing indicators that are based on qualitatively assessing remotely sensed changes in vegetation cover. Using archived Landsat imagery and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEMs, we found for example that LI indicated improvements in the condition or health of a rangeland paddock that was monitored from 1980 to 2002. This paddock is located in central Australia and its improved health is documented by photographs and field data. Although the full applicability of LI remains to be explored, we have demonstrated that it has the potential to serve as a useful ecological indicator for monitoring the health of arid and semiarid landscapes.},

	abstract = {Semiarid ecosystems such as grasslands are characterized by high temporal variability in abiotic factors, which has led to suggestions that management actions may be more effective in some years than others. Here we examine this hypothesis in the context of grassland restoration, which faces two major obstacles: the contingency of native grass establishment on unpredictable precipitation, and competition from introduced species. We established replicated restoration experiments over three years at two sites in the northern Great Plains in order to examine the extent to which the success of several restoration strategies varied between sites and among years. We worked in 50-yr-old stands of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), an introduced perennial grass that has been planted on {\textgreater}10 × 106 ha in western North America. Establishment of native grasses was highly contingent on local conditions, varying fourfold among years and threefold between sites. Survivorship also varied greatly and increased significantly with summer precipitation. No consistent differences were found between drilling and broadcasting in their effects on establishment, but survivorship was nearly threefold higher in broadcast plots. Plots without seed added, or with native hay added, had almost no seedlings of native grasses. In contrast, broadcasting the residue remaining after cleaning seeds from native hay produced the highest seedling densities of any treatment. Competition from A. cristatum was significantly and consistently reduced through annual application of a generalist herbicide (glyphosate), which increased native grass establishment and survivorship and the richness and total cover of native species. Herbicide decreased standing crop and increased soil moisture and available nitrogen. A. cristatum was controlled without suppressing native vegetation, both by spraying in early spring, which selectively killed the cool-season A. cristatum, and by application with a wick, which selectively killed the taller A. cristatum. A. cristatum persisted over four years, however, in spite of annual herbicide application. A. cristatum cover in control plots increased significantly with summer precipitation. In summary, broadcasting and drilling differed little in their effects on establishment, but broadcasting increased survivorship and will allow the emergence of plant-induced heterogeneity. Competition from introduced species can be reduced but not eliminated by continuing herbicide application. Lastly, the positive relationships between precipitation and both A. cristatum and native seedling survivorship suggest that management should focus on controlling A. cristatum during dry years and on introducing native species during wet years.

We asked whether the location of an ecotone separating grass-dominated and sparsely vegetated areas reflected only historical variation in degradation or was related to variation in inherent soil properties. We then asked whether changes in the cover and spatial organization of vegetated and bare patches assessed using repeat aerial photography reflected self-organizing dynamics unrelated to soil variation or the stable patterning of soil variation. We found that the present-day ecotone was related to a shift from more weakly to more strongly developed soils. Parts of the ecotone were stable over a 60-year period, but shifts between bare and vegetated states, as well as persistently vegetated and bare states, occurred largely in small ({\textless}40 m2) patches throughout the study area. The probability that patches were presently vegetated or bare, as well as the probability that vegetation persisted and/or established over the 60-year period, was negatively related to surface calcium carbonate and positively related to subsurface clay content. Thus, only a fraction of the landscape was susceptible to vegetation change, and the sparsely vegetated area probably featured a higher frequency of susceptible soil patches. Patch dynamics and self-organizing processes can be constrained by subtle (and often unrecognized) soil heterogeneity.},

This paper uses experimental manipulations of seed densities and ant populations to examine the likely impact of seed predation by ants on seedling recruitment in Eucalyptus baxteri and Casuarina pusilla. When seedfall was light, as usually occurs in the absence of fire, the elimination of ants resulted in a 15-fold increase in seedling densities for E. baxteri, whose seeds are removed at particularly high rates. Seeds of C. pusilla are removed less rapidly by ants, and increases in seedling densities following ant elimination were less marked for this species. Experimental dumpings of seeds at high densities, simulating the massive release of seeds from woody fruits which occurs following fire, resulted in predator satiation and in comparison to controls produced high numbers of seedlings. These results suggest that seed predation by ants limits seedling recruitment in the absence of fire, and that predator satiation plays an important role in successful recruitment following fire.},

	abstract = {Revegetation of degraded arid lands often involves supplementing impoverished seed banks and improving the seedbed, yet these approaches frequently fail. To understand these failures, we tracked the fates of seeds for six shrub species that were broadcast across two contrasting surface disturbances common to the Mojave Desert—sites compacted by concentrated vehicle use and trenched sites where topsoil and subsurface soils were mixed. We evaluated seedbed treatments that enhance soil-seed contact (tackifier) and create surface roughness while reducing soil bulk density (harrowing). We also explored whether seed harvesting by granivores and seedling suppression by non-native annuals influence the success of broadcast seeding in revegetating degraded shrublands. Ten weeks after treatments, seeds readily moved off of experimental plots in untreated compacted sites, but seed movements were reduced 32\% by tackifier and 55\% through harrowing. Harrowing promoted seedling emergence in compacted sites, particularly for the early-colonizing species Encelia farinosa, but tackifier was largely ineffective. The inherent surface roughness of trenched sites retained three times the number of seeds than compacted sites, but soil mixing during trench development likely altered the suitability of the seedbed thus resulting in poor seedling emergence. Non-native annuals had little influence on seed fates during our study. In contrast, the prevalence of harvester ants increased seed removal on compacted sites, whereas rodent activity influenced removal on trenched sites. Future success of broadcast seeding in arid lands depends on evaluating disturbance characteristics prior to seeding and selecting appropriate species and seasons for application.},

The 'old paradigm' in range ecology depended on three main sets of actors: (i) range ecologists who believed in Clement's (1916) model of succession and ecological stability; (ii) economists who believed in Hardin's (1968) concepts of the 'tragedy of the commons'; and (iii) authoritarian administrations which saw pastoralists as backward and destructive, and which had the power and the structures to use and perpetuate scientific paradigms. The so-called 'new paradigm' sees semi-arid ecosystems as being in permanent disequilibrium but persistent on broad temporal and spatial scales whilst many indigenous pastoral strategies are carefully adapted to these characteristics.},

	abstract = {Establishment of seedlings of Bromus inermis, a native grass species of China, into a degraded steppe grassland was studied in an experiment with a factorial combination of different soil disturbance (control and harrowing), cutting post-sowing (control and cutting), nitrogen (N) fertilizer application (0 and 100 kg KNO3 hm−2) and seed rate (400, 800 and 1200 seeds m−2) treatments. Seedling emergence and survival rates, and plant performance, were followed over 2 years. Seedling emergence was increased by soil disturbance (harrowing). Cutting post-sowing and N fertilizer application did not increase seedling emergence. Seedling survival rates at the end of first growing season were strongly influenced by harrowing and the use of higher seed rates. Seedling height was higher in the harrowing and the N fertilizer application treatments and at the higher seed rates. Seedling survival rates in the second growing season were low but much higher with harrowing than the other treatments. Soil disturbance by harrowing may have increased contact between seed and soil, and reduced competition from established plants. It is concluded that, for the restoration of degraded semi-arid grassland in China by re-seeding, soil surface disturbance is necessary for successful seedling establishment, and modest seeding rates should be used to control costs.},

	abstract = {Flows on a bajada surface in the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico show a discontinuous pattern, with alternating areas of channelization and deposition. Based on their planform appearance, we have termed the depositional areas ‘beads’. Instrumented catchments demonstrated that in comparison to ‘normal’ dendritic catchments, the beads show net infiltration in all but the largest flow events. Net accumulation of the bead surface appears to occur in years of lower than average rainfall, but the surface is dynamic and suffers net erosion in wetter years. The beads have significantly higher total vegetation covers, and contain higher proportions of grass species (Muhlenbergia porteri) as well as the creosotebush that characterizes the bajada surface in general. Creosotebush in the beads show consistently lower values ofδ13 C, suggesting that they are less moisture stressed than creosotebush elsewhere on the bajada. Values of δ15N are higher in the bead creosotebush, suggesting higher rates of soil–nitrogen transformations and greater loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere by denitrification. Both of these factors are again consistent with higher infiltration and thus moisture contents in the beads. In contrast, xylem-pressure potentials in creosotebush in the bead taken before the summer monsoonal season suggest that plants within the bead are more moisture stressed than those outwith the bead. Four possible explanations are offered for this apparent discrepancy: the greater cover and biomass of plants in the bead leads to higher stresses at the end of the drought period; spatial variability in soil texture means that some areas of the bead retain less moisture; more available water in the bead goes to the grass plants that concentrate their roots near the surface; and there is greater competition in the bead during times of drought stress.

Overall, these results are compatible with an ‘islands of fertility’ interpretation of desertification operating in the American Southwest, albeit on a larger spatial scale than usually attributed. The concentrations of nutrient, water and seed resources may mean that these sites are favourable for attempts to reverse the desertification process. However, they appear dynamic with a life cycle of about 30 years.},

Viable seeds of perennials were rare in undisturbed areas (3–4 seeds/m2) and declined to \&lt;1 seed/m2 within disturbed sites. Annual seed densities were an order of magnitude greater than those of perennials, were one-third the undisturbed seed densities on compacted sites, but doubled on trenched sites relative to controls. On trenched sites, greater litter cover comprising the infructescences of the dominant spring annuals, and low gravel content, enhanced seed densities of both annuals and perennials. Litter cover and surface ruggedness were the best explanations for viable perennial seed densities on compacted sites, but litter cover and the presence of a common harvester ant explained annual seed densities better than any other surface characteristics that were examined. Surface disturbances can have a varied impact on the condition of the soil surface in arid lands. Nevertheless, the consistently positive relationship between ground cover of litter and viable seed density emphasizes the importance of litter as an indicator of site degradation and recovery potential in arid lands.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	abstract = {Understanding species establishment patterns and community structure following disturbance, and developing effective restoration methods requires knowledge of both the movements and fates of seeds. I used a restoration experiment in a severely disturbed sagebrush steppe ecosystem near Kemmerer, Wyoming to examine the effects of soil surface characteristics and seed morphology on seed entrapment and retention, and the effects of soil surface characteristics on soil water potential and seedling emergence and survival. Seeds of native species with awns, mucilaginous seedcoats, wings, hairy pappi, or no appendages were sown over soil surface treatments consisting of silty loam soil, sand, gravel, surface mulch, shrub mimics, and large and small holes. Seeds that lacked appendages and that had small surface areas did not exhibit significant horizontal movement or redistribution. Seeds with appendages that resulted in exposure of a large surface area to the wind did exhibit significant redistribution, despite apparent adaptations for seed burial or retention. When the entire seed population was considered, the effectiveness of the treatments for trapping and retaining seeds was large holes {\textgreater} small holes ≥ gravel ≥ shrub mimics {\textgreater} soil ≥ sand. Surface mulch neither gained nor lost seeds. The most effective treatments for seedling emergence had among the least negative soil water potentials and included large holes, surface mulch, and sand. Gravel provided an inadequate growing medium, and both shrub mimics and small holes accumulated fine-textured soils resulting in highly negative water potentials and low seedling emergence. Once a seedling emerged, the probability of survival was reasonably high (56.3\% over 2 yr) regardless of treatment. This study indicates that soil surfaces that trap and retain high densities of seeds with large surface areas may have little or no effect on seeds with small surface areas, and may or may not result in high seedling emergence and survival. Restoring diverse native ecosystems requires creating soil surface features that can trap and retain seeds with varying morphologies as well as provide favorable conditions for seedling establishment.},

	abstract = {S-PLUS is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This third edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS. The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S language. The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and UNIX. There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions, further exercises, and new features of S-PLUS as they are introduced. Dr. Venables is now Statistician with CSRIO in Queensland, having been at the Department of Statistics, University of Adelaide, for many years previously. He has given many short courses on S-PLUS in Australia, Europe, and the USA. Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and neural networks.},

	abstract = {Abstract Interpretation of assessment and monitoring data requires information about how reference conditions and ecological resilience vary in space and time. Reference conditions used as benchmarks are often specified via potential-based land classifications (e.g., ecological sites) that describe the plant communities potentially observed in an area based on soil and climate. State-and-transition models (STMs) coupled to ecological sites specify indicators of ecological resilience and thresholds. Although general concepts surrounding STMs and ecological sites have received increasing attention, strategies to apply and quantify these concepts have not. In this paper, we outline concepts and a practical approach to potential-based land classification and STM development. Quantification emphasizes inventory techniques readily available to natural resource professionals that reveal processes interacting across spatial scales. We recommend a sequence of eight steps for the co-development of ecological sites and STMs, including 1) creation of initial concepts based on literature and workshops; 2) extensive, low-intensity traverses to refine initial concepts and to plan inventory; 3) development of a spatial hierarchy for sampling based on climate, geomorphology, and soils; 4) stratified medium-intensity inventory of plant communities and soils across a broad extent and with large sample sizes; 5) storage of plant and soil data in a single database; 6) model-building and analysis of inventory data to test initial concepts; 7) support and/or refinement of concepts; and 8) high-intensity characterization and monitoring of states. We offer a simple example of how data assembled via our sequence are used to refine ecological site classes and STMs. The linkage of inventory to expert knowledge and site-based mechanistic experiments and monitoring provides a powerful means for specifying management hypotheses and, ultimately, promoting resilience in grassland, shrubland, savanna, and forest ecosystems. ,  Resumen La interpretación de la evaluación y el monitoreo de datos, exigen que haya información de cómo las condiciones de referencia y resistencia ecológica varían en espacio y tiempo. Las condiciones de referencia que se usan como puntos de comparación se describen a menudo mediante las clasificaciones de terrenos basándose en su potencial (por ejemplo, sitio ecológico) de comunidades de plantas presentes en un área, en base a suelo y clima. Los Modelos de Estado y Transición (METs) relacionados a sitios ecológicos, son indicadores específicos de los límites de resistencia ecológica. Aunque se ha dado mucha atención a los conceptos generales que rodean los METs y los sitios ecológicos, no ha sido así con las estrategias para aplicar y calificar esos conceptos. En este trabajo, damos una idea general de los conceptos y un enfoque práctico para la clasificación de terrenos en base a su potencial, así como para el desarrollo de METs. La calificación enfatiza técnicas de inventario fácilmente accesibles a los profesionales en recursos naturales presentando un proceso de interacción a través de escalas espaciales. Nosotros recomendamos una secuencia de ocho pasos para el desarrollo de sitios ecológicos y METs, como son: 1) creación de conceptos iniciales basados en literatura y talleres; 2) extensivos viajes de reconocimiento para el refinamiento de los conceptos iniciales y planear el inventario; 3) desarrollo de una escala espacial para muestreo, basándose en clima, forma del terreno, y suelos; 4) estratificación de inventario de media intensidad de las comunidades de plantas y suelos a través de una gran cantidad de muestras de tamaño grande; 5) almacenamiento de datos de plantas y suelos en una sola base de datos; 6) construcción del modelo y análisis de los datos inventariados para evaluar los conceptos iníciales; 7) apoyo y/o refinamiento de conceptos; y 8) intensa caracterización y monitoreo de las situaciones. Ofrecemos, además, un ejemplo sencillo de cómo colectar los datos, mediante el uso de nuestra secuencia para refinar la clase de sitio ecológico y los METs. El enlace del inventario con el conocimiento experto y la mecánica de experimentos y monitoreo basados en el potencial de sitio, proporciona un medio efectivo para especificar hipótesis de manejo y finalmente para promover la recuperación de pastizales, matorrales, sabanas, y ecosistemas forestales.},

The DHS were initially designed to expand on demographic, fertility and family planning data collected in the World Fertility Surveys and Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys, and continue to provide an important resource for the monitoring of vital statistics and population health indicators in low- and middle-income countries. The DHS collect a wide range of objective and self-reported data with a strong focus on indicators of fertility, reproductive health, maternal and child health, mortality, nutrition and self-reported health behaviours among adults. Key advantages of the DHS include high response rates, national coverage, high quality interviewer training, standardized data collection procedures across countries and consistent content over time, allowing comparability across populations cross-sectionally and over time. Data from DHS facilitate epidemiological research focused on monitoring of prevalence, trends and inequalities. A variety of robust observational data analysis methods have been used, including cross-sectional designs, repeated cross-sectional designs, spatial and multilevel analyses, intra-household designs and cross-comparative analyses. In this profile, we present an overview of the DHS along with an introduction to the potential scope for these data in contributing to the field of micro- and macro-epidemiology.

The latter two pathways are suggested when one or more “thresholds of irreversibility” have been crossed in the course of ecosystem degradation, and when “passive” restoration to a presumed predisturbance condition is deemed impossible. The young but burgeoning field of ecological restoration, and the older field of rehabilitation and sustainable range management of arid and semiarid lands (ASAL), are found to have much in common, especially compared with the reallocation of lands, which is often carried out without reference to pre-existing ecosystems. After clarifying some basic terminology, we present 18 vital ecosystem attributes for evaluating stages of degradation and planning experiments in the restoration or rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. Finally, we offer 10 hypotheses concerning ecological restoration and rehabilitation as they apply to ASAL and perhaps to all terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Identifying cloud interference in satellite-derived data is a critical step toward developing useful remotely sensed products. Most MODIS land products use a combination of the MODIS (MOD35) cloud mask and the ‘internal’ cloud mask of the surface reflectance product (MOD09) to mask clouds, but there has been little discussion of how these masks differ globally. We calculated global mean cloud frequency for both products, for 2009, and found that inflated proportions of observations were flagged as cloudy in the Collection 5 MOD35 product. These erroneously categorized areas were spatially and environmentally non-random and usually occurred over high-albedo land cover types (such as grassland and savanna) in several regions around the world. Additionally, we found that spatial variability in the processing path applied in the Collection 5 MOD35 algorithm affects the likelihood of a cloudy observation by up to 20\% in some areas. These factors result in abrupt transitions in recorded cloud frequency across land cover and processing-path boundaries impeding their use for fine-scale spatially contiguous modeling applications. We show that together, these artifacts have resulted in significantly decreased and spatially biased data availability for Collection 5 MOD35-derived composite MODIS land products such as land surface temperature (MOD11) and net primary productivity (MOD17). Finally, we compare our results to mean cloud frequency in the new Collection 6 MOD35 product, and find that land cover artifacts have been reduced but not eliminated. Collection 6 thus increases data availability for some regions and land cover types in MOD35-derived products but practitioners need to consider how the remaining artifacts might affect their analysis.},

	abstract = {We define seed limitation to be an increase in population size following seed addition. Here, we briefly consider how theoretical models deal with seed limitation and how seed sowing experiments can be used to unravel the extent of seed limitation in natural systems. We review two types of seed addition experiments: seed augmentation studies where seeds are added to existing populations; and seed introductions where seeds are sown in unoccupied sites. Overall, approximately 50\% of seed augmentation experiments show evidence of seed limitation. These studies show that seed limitation tends to occur more commonly in early successional habitats and in early successional species. Most of the studies have concentrated on simply categorising populations as seed- or microsite-limited, but we believe that seed sowing experiments could be used to reveal much more about community structure, and we discuss possible future directions.  In 53\% of introduction studies (where seeds were sown at sites from which the species was known to be absent) the introduced species was recorded in at least one of the experimental sites following sowing. However, of the subset of studies where both seedlings and adult plants were recorded, 64\% of sites contained seedlings while only 23\% contained adults. This implies that, for many species, conditions for establishment are more stringent than conditions for germination. The successful establishment of plants in unoccupied patches indicates the potential for immigration to enhance local diversity (the spatial mass effect). Few studies continued monitoring for long enough to determine whether or not self-sustaining populations were successfully established, and no study attempted to link introduction sites to a putative natural source of propagules, or considered the dynamics of the metapopulation as a whole.},

	abstract = {Direct seeding methods to revegetate abandoned farmland were tested at a desert site west of Phoenix, Arizona. Native seeds were broadcast onto plots prepared by mulching, imprinting, chiseling, and fertilizing with phosphorous in a split-plot design. Each main plot was split into subplots that were not irrigated, irrigated with saline (3.25 dS/m) well water, or irrigated and hand weeded of Salsola iberica. Native seeds germinated poorly on all treatments, and three annual exotic weeds (Brassica nigra, S. iberica, and Schismus spp.) dominated the plots. None of the main plot treatments (mulching, imprinting, chiseling, or fertilizing) had a significant effect on seed germination or canopy cover. Irrigation increased plant cover on plots, but weeds dominated the cover ({\textless}4\% native species, up to 50\% weeds). Near the end of the second growing season a seed bank study was conducted in the greenhouse. Undisturbed desert soil had relatively few weed seeds and more native plant seeds than the disturbed agricultural soil samples, which had few viable native seeds and were dominated by Schismus spp., B. nigra, and S. iberica. The results illustrate the difficulty of establishing native plants on abandoned desert farmland due to the dominance of weedy species, the presence of salts in the soil, and the lack of adequate soil moisture in the treatments without supplemental irrigation.},

We seeded and applied the treatments prior to summer rains on a sandy loam soil in southern Arizona for 3 years. In a wet year (1987) when surface soil water was estimated to be available for at least 24 consecutive days, heavy trampling and land imprinting increased emergence of blue panic and land imprinting increased emergence of Cochise lovegrass. In that year, lovegrass emergence was high even on undisturbed plots. In a moderately wet year (1988), surface soil water was available for periods of 6-9 days during seedling emergence and greater disturbance, either by heavy trampling, land imprinting and/or root plowing or ripping produced higher emergence than light trampling and nondisturbance. In a dry year (1989), surface soil water was available for periods of 2-3 days and seedling emergence was low and generally similar for all treatments. Sideoats grama emergence was low all 3 years, but was highest in 1988 when initial thunderstorms were followed closely by subsequent storms. Seedbed disturbance by cattle and mechanical methods may enhance revegetation in the Southwest in years of moderate precipitation but may be unnecessary in wet years or futile in dry years, depending on species and soils.},

	abstract = {Uncontrolled wildfire in arid and semiarid ecosystems has become an increasing concern in recent decades. Active rehabilitation of fire-affected areas is often quickly initiated to minimize long-term ecosystem damage. However, the complex soil-geomorphic-vegetation patterns and low and variable moisture conditions in these regions makes restoration challenging. To further inform these post-fire management decisions, we present results from 5 years of vegetation and sediment flux monitoring following the Milford Flat Fire in west-central Utah, USA. Our sampling design includes monitoring plots in areas not burned, areas burned but where no rehabilitation was attempted, and burned areas where various rehabilitation approaches were implemented. At each of the 25 plots, vegetation cover and composition data were collected annually, and wind-driven sediment flux was measured using passive dust traps. To evaluate effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation treatments in establishing desired species and limiting dominance of undesired species, we analyzed the temporal response of individual species and functional groups as well as community-level multivariate responses. The warm and dry conditions that persisted for approximately 12 months post-treatment, coupled with the surface disturbing rehabilitation approaches used, resulted in near-surface dust fluxes several orders of magnitude higher in treated areas than in unburned or burned areas where no rehabilitation occurred. These dry conditions and high surface sediment flux limited the establishment of seeded species in rehabilitation areas for nearly 3 years. Post-fire rehabilitation did not limit dominance by invasive annual species of concern. Perennial species composition in the areas burned but not subject to post-fire rehabilitation was relatively similar to unburned throughout the study period. In contrast, the burned plots where rehabilitation was attempted were characterized by no ({\textless}3\%) perennial cover or, in response to moister conditions, seeded forage species. These results suggest the post-fire rehabilitation efforts conducted in the lower elevation regions affected by the Milford Flat Fire were not generally successful. Though dry conditions are likely to blame for the lack of success, the low and variable precipitation characteristic of these regions suggest future post-fire rehabilitation decisions must assume that precipitation is going to be insufficient and plan rehabilitation efforts that are resilient to dry conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  Harsh conditions in arid and semi-arid environments make seedling establishment rare. Plant recruitment in arid environments often occurs only in years with above average rainfall or in safe sites under the canopy of nurse plants that provide shelter from high temperatures and low moisture. Associations of establishing seedlings with adult plants are referred to as nurse-protégé interactions and are thought to be commensalisms in which seedlings benefit from the micro-environment created by adult plants with no effect for the latter. This phenomenon is thought to be more frequent in harsh than in mild environments and appears to occur frequently in deserts and arid and semi-arid biomes. Here, we investigate whether nurse-protégé interactions are more common in arid environments by searching the published literature from the previous 92 years using the terms nurse plants, protégé plants, facilitation, nucleation and facultative mutualism. We then quantitatively compared these reports from arid zones to other environments. A total of 296 papers were found which referred to nurse-protégé interactions. More than half (158) focused on arid and semi-arid zones. This information was also used to explore hypotheses of potential causative forces that might have selected for such interactions in the arid zones such as seed trapping, nutrient, moisture, protection from browsing or trampling and support availability. Because of the large number of different nurse species (147, from 98 genera and 40 families) and protégé species (429, from 273 genera and 84 families), described across a diversity of environments, we suggest that there may be more than one causative factor selecting for nurse-protégé interactions in arid and semi-arid environments.},

Foraging experiments were performed which involved providing seeds within taxon-specific enclosures in scattered and clumped distribution on the soil surface and 1.5 cm below the surface. These experiments indicated that ants only foraged on the surface, whereas rodents were able to garner seeds from below the ground. Ants foraged @?85\% of the experimental seed distributions on the surface and were able to retrieve @?45\% of the seeds they detected during any 24-h experimental run. Rodents detected 100\% of all distributions and got @?96\% of the seeds from all distributions except scattered/belowground, from which they gathered only 75\% of the seeds. Three-year experiments using exclosures which excluded either ants, rodents, both taxa, or neither taxon, indicated that either taxon alone, or both taxon together, have a severe impact on the density of seeds in the soil. When neither is present, seed densities remain high. Furthermore, any combination of granivores greatly reduces the number of samples with either high numbers of seeds or high biomass of seeds, although the ants tend to leave a greater number of large clumps of seeds than the rodents. Clumping indices are also extremely high in the absence of granivores. In opposition to the apparently detrimental effect of seed use by the granivores, surface seed-caching by rodents appears to enhance seed germination.},

	abstract = {Post-dispersal seed predation is only one of many factors underlying plant demography and evolution. Nevertheless, the generalist feeding habits of many post-dispersal seed predators and the limited ability of plants either to compensate for or to respond to post-dispersal seed losses directly suggest that post-dispersal seed predation may have a considerable impact on plant populations. Seed predators probably have little direct influence on the demography of plants that regenerate exclusively by vegetative means or are buffered by a large active seed bank, but such species are only a minority in most plant communities.

In general, ants are significant post-dispersal seed predators in arid and semi-arid ecosystems while they act mainly as seed dispersers rather than as predators in temperate ecosystems. Although studies have probably underestimated the importance of invertebrates and birds as seed predators, rodents appear to have greater potential to influence seed dynamics, and are particularly important in temperate ecosystems. For example, production of mast seed crops is more effective at satiating specialist invertebrate seed predators than generalist vertebrates, and recruitment may be limited by post-dispersal seed predation even during mast years.

Both spatial variation in post-dispersal seed predation and differences in predation between species are important elements which facilitate the coexistence of different plant species. Where microsites are limiting, selective post-dispersal seed predators can influence pre-emptive competition for these microsites. Seed size determines the extent of density-dependent predation and the exploitation of buried seed. This suggests that post-dispersal seed predators may also play a role in the evolution of seed characteristics. However, conclusions regarding the ecological and evolutionary impact of post-dispersal seed predators will remain speculative without a more substantial empirical base.},

	abstract = {Germination behavior is one of the earliest phenotypes expressed by plants. This fact has several consequences for the evolution of postgermination traits, ecological niches, and geographic ranges. By determining the conditions that plants experience after they germinate, germination influences phenotypic expression of postgermination traits, natural selection on them, and their genetic basis. The breadth of germination niches may influence the ecological breadth and geographic ranges of species. Because germination is expressed early, it is frequently subjected to natural selection before other traits are expressed. We review evidence for natural selection on and adaptation of germination and discuss how the breadth of the germination niche is associated with the ecological niche and range of plant species. We review evidence for the coevolution of germination and postgermination traits and compare germination to postgermination niches. Finally, we discuss how germination responses to altered environments can influence species distribution and the evolution of postgermination traits after environmental change.},

The fixation position of the achene in a number of Compositae is imposed by the pappus, and ensures that the area of the achene most efficient in taking up water for germination is in contact with the substrate. Other morphological adaptations of seeds which achieve this are discussed. Modifications to the microsites on a soil surface, as imposed by obstructions which modify achene-moisture relationships, affect seed germination and establishment. The differences in response, both between species and treatments, depend on the germination requirements of the seed. The subtlety of microsite conditions can be illustrated only indirectly, because no apparatus exists, at the scale of seed size, for monitoring micro-climatic conditions. Increased soil compaction reduces germination through the reduction of available microsites, while establishment is reduced because of the mechanical barrier to radicle penetration. The anchoring effect of morphological features of the achene may aid radicle penetration by allowing it to exert maximum growth pressure. Soil crusting may reduce germination and establishment, especially when the clay content of the soil is high. The impact of raindrops changes soil microtopography and may improve conditions for germination, although it may also disturb and damage slow-growing seedlings. The different behaviour and response of seeds and seedlings of individual species, to surface soil conditions, regulate the seedling population that establishes at any one site, and may be an important element maintaining floristic diversity.},

	abstract = {Based on resource availability models of plant defense investment, several authors have predicted and documented that herbivores tend to accelerate the pace of plant community succession. A literature survey of experimental and observational tests of the effects of above-ground, native herbivores on terrestrial plant succession reveals a more complex pattern than anticipated from earlier reviews on this subject. Although herbivory tends to hasten succession from grasses, shrubs, and pioneer trees to persistent trees (often including conifers), it typically retards succession from earlier seres, if such seres are present (e.g., as in secondary succession of old fields). The dichotomy in herbivore effects early and late in old field succession reflects differentially high herbivory on intermediate seral species (again grasses, shrubs and pioneer trees), whose principal defense against herbivores is rapid, compensatory growth in comparatively favorable resource environments. In plant communities ranging from boreal forests to African savannas, both herbivore preferences, and their effects on community succession, may be predictable from the underlying plant resource regimes and plant defenses evolved in response to these regimes. Individually or as a "functional group", palatable species might be regarded as "keystone resources", whose fluctuating abundances are likely to influence communities of both producers and consumer species on a local and landscape scale. In contrast to herbivory, granivory is predicted and found to fall differentially on larger-seeded, later successional species, and to inhibit succession in a diversity of plant communities. In this way, granivores often behave as "keystone predators". At present, there are too few data to place confidence in the generality of this result. An understanding of patterns in the effects of consumers on plant community development may be useful for both managing natural ecosystems and restoring disturbed habitats.},

In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to “spatial sorting bias”: the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45\% and better than Bioclim for 67\% of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver–operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence–absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model.},

Cross–scale interactions are increasing recognized as having important influences on ecosystem processes, yet they pose formidable challenges for understanding and forecasting ecosystem dynamics. In this introduction to the special feature, “Cross–scale interactions and pattern–process relationships”, we provide a synthetic framework for understanding the causes and consequences of cross–scale interactions. Our framework focuses on the importance of transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity at intermediate scales in linking fine- and broad-scale patterns and processes. Transfer processes and spatial heterogeneity can either amplify or attenuate system response to broad-scale drivers. Providing a framework to explain cross–scale interactions is an important step in improving our understanding and ability to predict the impacts of propagating events and to ameliorate these impacts through proactive measures.},

The greatest interannual variability in ANPP occurred in grasslands and old fields, with forests the least variable. At a continental scale, ANPP was strongly correlated with annual precipitation. However, interannual variability in ANPP was not related to variability in precipitation. Instead, maximum variability in ANPP occurred in biomes where high potential growth rates of herbaceous vegetation were combined with moderate variability in precipitation. In the most dynamic biomes, ANPP responded more strongly to wet than to dry years. Recognition of the fourfold range in ANPP dynamics across biomes and of the factors that constrain this variability is critical for detecting the biotic impacts of global change phenomena.},

In 1990, seed densities varied at the largest spatial scale sampled — the colony foraging area. Seed abundance varied temporally in both years. Harvester ants affected the patterns of seed density in two ways. First, seed numbers in 1989 were higher in interspace areas away from foraging trails than in interspace areas near them, indicating that trails restrict colony search effort. Second, and contrary to our expectations, seed numbers in 1990 were higher near harvester ant nests than in surrounding areas. This difference was attributable to higher densities of the alien annual grassBromus tectorumand suggests that harvester ants indirectly facilitateB. tectorumnear their nests.},

	abstract = {In studying correlates of social behavior, attitudes, and beliefs, a measurement model is required to combine information across a large number of item responses. Multiple constructs are often of interest, and covariates are often multilevel (e.g., measured at the person and neighborhood level). Some item–level missing data can be expected. This paper proposes a multivariate, multilevel Rasch model with random effects for these purposes and illustrates its application to self–reports of criminal behavior. Under assumptions of conditional independence and additivity, the approach enables the investigator to calibrate the items and persons on an interval scale, assess reliability at the person and neighborhood levels, study the correlations among crime types at each level, assess the proportion of variation in each crime type that lies at each level, incorporate covariates at each level, and accommodate data missing at random. Using data on 20 item responses from 2842 adolescents ages 9 to 18 nested within 196 census tracts in Chicago, we illustrate how to test key assumptions, how to adjust the model in light of diagnostic analyses, and how to interpret parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {Traditional ecological models have focused mainly on competition between plants, but recent research has shown that some plants benefit from closely associated neighbors, a phenomenon known as facilitation. There is increasing experimental evidence suggesting that facilitation has a place in mainstream ecological theory, but it also has a practical side when applied to the restoration of degraded environments, particularly dry-lands, alpine, or other limiting habitats. Where restoration fails because of harsh environmental conditions or intense herbivory, species that minimize these effects could be used to improve performance in nearby target species. Although there are few examples of the application of this “nursing” procedure worldwide, experimental data are promising, and show enhanced plant survival and growth in areas close to nurse plants. We discuss the potential for including nurse plants in restoration management procedures to improve the success rate of such projects.},

	abstract = {Grasslands dominated by Stipa tenacissima are important ecosystems in the arid and semiarid climates of western Mediterranean, where they have originated by degradation of open dry forests and shrublands. At present, although the level of exploitation in these ecosystems is very low, succession processes seem to have stopped. In this study, we explore the role of microsite and post-dispersal seed predation on the seedling emergence of two species from advanced successional stages (Rhamnus lycioides, Quercus coccifera), three species from degraded stages (Cistus clusii, Helianthemum violaceum, Anthyllis terniflora), and of the dominant species (Stipa tenacissima). Seeds of these species were sown in plots divided into two microsites: (i) under tussocks of S. tenacissima and (ii) in the bare soil between tussocks. Soil moisture was significantly higher in the tussock microsites. The interaction observed between microsite and time, reflected the slower drying process under tussocks. Seed predation was in general high and differed significantly between species but not between microsites. Q. coccifera was especially affected by predation. The only germination detected in gap areas was that of H. violaceum. The results pointed to a direct facilitative effect of tussock grass on the germination in R. lycioides (20.4±8.0\%) and S. tenacissima (41.3±5.7\%) while the corresponding figures for bare ground were 0\%. These results suggest that the recovery of potential vegetation in this ecosystem is not possible or, at least, is very slow because the residual shrub patches do not generate a sufficient number of seeds able to disperse to favorable germination microsites. S. tenacissima may act as facilitator of seedling recruitment if there is a supply of diaspores.},

To improve clarity, we propose that assessments of desertification and land transformation be placed within a state change–land-use change (SC–LUC) framework. This framework considers desertification as state changes occurring within the context of particular land uses (eg rangeland, cropland) that interact with land-use change. State changes that can be readily reversed are distinguished from regime shifts, which are state changes involving persistent alterations to vegetation or soil properties. Pressures driving the transformation of rangelands to other types of land uses may be low, fluctuating, or high, and may influence and be influenced by state change. We discuss how the SC–LUC perspective can guide more effective assessment of desertification and management of drylands.},
